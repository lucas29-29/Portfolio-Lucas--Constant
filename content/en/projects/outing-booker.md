## BACKGROUND

During my last year of Bachelor Webdesign, in 2023, we had an end of year project called MyDigitalProject
which consisted in the conception and the realization, in group, of a digital project, which could emanate from the
students or respond to a real demand.

In both cases, the project had to respect the following constraints

- Respond to a need or a use
- Be technically feasible and economically viable
- Represent an interesting technical challenge
- Satisfy the client and/or end-users
- Meet the specifications

This project was carried out collectively and resulted in the production of various deliverables specific to the design
and implementation of web and digital projects. It allowed us to evaluate our ability to :

- Mobilise and deepen the knowledge and skills acquired in training
- Implement project management methods and tools
- Work in a multidisciplinary team
- Defend their project in front of a professional jury

## THE PROJECT

We therefore chose to create Outing Booker, which is a web and mobile application that facilitates the booking of travel
to specific events (conferences, concerts, conventions, etc.) for professionals and individuals.

The application will be able to automatically book all means of transport, accommodation as well as the entrance ticket
to the event.

After booking all the elements, the application will make a complete summary in the form of a timeline with push
notifications with the information of the next stage of the trip.

In case of delay, cancellation of transport or accommodation, it will also be able to inform about alternatives to reach
the destination.

## MY CONTRIBUTION

I was the project manager, so I was the one who set up all the project monitoring on Notion and ensured that the
different stages in the life of the project went smoothly.

First, with the person in charge of the graphic charter, we chose colours, typography and a coherent universe with the
market research carried out by the marketing people.

And as a web designer, I was in charge of making the wireframes and the prototyped models of the mobile and web
application on Figma.

Finally, as I'm also a student developer, I integrated the models on React and styled everything in SCSS.
