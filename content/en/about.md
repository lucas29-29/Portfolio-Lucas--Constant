My entry into the digital world goes back to my father's computer, with which I discovered video games, word processing,
video and even hardware.

But it was in the second year of secondary school with the ICN exploration field: Computer Science and Digital Creation
that I discovered web development and digital creation, the fact of being able to create something interactive and
shareable appealed to me straight away.

Then, in the final year of high school, I went to Engineering Science with the option of ISN: Computer Science and
Digital Science, and that's where I was able to really develop my passion for web development by coding my very first
website and discovering JavaScript. It was by affirming this passion that I decided to study the web and more
specifically web and application development.

I then joined MyDigitalSchool to follow a Bachelor's degree with a Web and Multimedia cycle for 2 years and a
specialized cycle for the last year. That's when I started to develop my first side-projects to discover and learn more
about web development. We had the possibility of doing a work-study programme from the second year onwards, so I joined
Kelcible as a web developer and naturally chose the web development option for this last year of the web and multimedia
cycle.

Up until then, I wanted to become a web developer, rather a front-end developer, but as my training progressed, I
discovered all the other jobs involved in the communication mode and especially in the creation of a website. That's
where I discovered UI/UX Design, and I loved the fact that I could develop and bring to life a project that I had fully
thought through and designed beforehand.

So for the year of specialization, I simply went to the Bachelor 3 Webdesign which includes both web development and
design. My interest in design allowed me to broaden the spectrum of my missions in the company and, for example, to
designate certain internal projects.
And I will continue this path next year by joining the Master UX/UI.
