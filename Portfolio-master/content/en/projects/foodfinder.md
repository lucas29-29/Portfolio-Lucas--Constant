During my first year of Bachelor, in 2021, for our mid-term exams we had to design and realize, in group, a fictitious
digital project or one that answered a real demand.

In both cases, the project had to respect the following constraints:

- Meet a need or a use
- Be technically feasible and economically viable
- Represent an interesting technical challenge
- Satisfy the client and/or the end-users
- Meet the specifications

This project was carried out collectively and resulted in the realization of various deliverables specific to the design
and implementation of web and digital projects. It allowed us to evaluate our abilities to :

- Mobilize and deepen the knowledge and skills acquired in training
- Implement project management methods and tools
- Defend their project in front of a jury

## THE PROJECT

We had chosen to create Rest'au Frigo, a website allowing to find recipes according to what we have in our fridge.

We had 2 weeks to :

- Make a market study
- Prepare and send user questionnaires
- Create a brand identity
- Create wireframes and responsive models
- Create a functional prototype
- Prepare an oral presentation and a rendering file

Personally, I took care of some of the wireframes and mockups, but mostly the prototype.

## FOODFINDER

FoodFinder is my vision of the project that I realized solo after the midterms, because I wanted to finalize and improve
the project. Being 5 on the project, we had to make compromises and choices to satisfy everyone's tastes because at that
time, we were not aware of the importance of compartmentalizing the work and dividing the tasks.

## DESIGN

So here is my redesign of the models:
