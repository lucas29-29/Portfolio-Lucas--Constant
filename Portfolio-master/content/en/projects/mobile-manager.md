## BACKGROUND

At Kelcible we were using the TapTap plugin to manage the mobile menus of our websites. However, this plugin was giving
us more problems than solutions. So I was asked to create a WordPress plugin that would allow us to manage the mobile
menu of a website, multilingual compatible.

## OBJECTIVES

The aim was to create a WordPress plugin that would allow a website's mobile menu to be managed.

The plugin had to meet several criteria:

- It must be compatible with the Polylang plugin that we use at the agency for multilingual websites.
- It must have an administration page to manage the menu and all the style options.
- Be as customisable as possible.

## THE DESIGN

The plugin is essentially functional, but the administration part is essential and must be as clear and ergonomic as
possible.

So I created a mock-up on Figma to visualise the final rendering and speed up development.

The most complicated part was correctly labelling each part of the plugin so that users could easily find their way
around and understand which part they were modifying. That's why I placed each part in separate blocks.

Still with a view to making the plugin as clear as possible, I decided to add an area at the top of the page where you
can view your changes in real time.
